Bussines Problem

The Financial Technology company (Fin-Tech Company) launch there a mobile app. This app used for financial purposes like bank loans, savings, etc. in one place. It has two versions free and premium. The free version app contains basic features and customer wants to use the premium feature then they have to pay some amount to unlock it.
he main goal of the company is to sell the premium version app with low advertisement cost but they don’t know how to do it. That’s a reason they are provided the premium feature in the free version app for 24 hours to collect the customer’s behavior. After that, the company hired the Machine Learning Engineer to find insight from the collected data (customer’s behavior).

The job of the ML engineer is to find or predict new customer who is interested to buy the product or not. If the customers will buy a product anyway so no need to give an offer to that customer and loss the business. Only give offers to those customers who are interested to use premium version app but they can’t afford its cost. So the company will give offers to those customers and earn more money.
